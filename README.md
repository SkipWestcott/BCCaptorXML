# LET'S TALK ABOUT BC CUSTOM SKILLS AND HOW THEY ARE USED
I'm sure you're here in part because of the extended BC Captor custom skills, so let's go through what they do, conceptually.

## TB Skills
* CurrentActor is to keep track from event-to-event who you previously flagged.
* IsThief/IsWarrior is a flag for those "character classes" and triggering specific events for them.
* CaptiveAffection/CaptiveObedience are generally pushed in opposite directions by kindness & cruelty.
* Devoted/Broken are the resulting flags for extreme kindess or cruelty over a long time (above 90).
* SocialEnergy is drained during Captive Dinners and Strolls. They will be unwilling to do 'certain things' without enough Social Energy.
* ClaimedWomb/Concubine are flags to trigger impregnation events; Concubine does not strictly work, since Captives who successfully join your clan by marriage are released...
* MindBroken comes from the Alchemist's potion. There are several flags here and a tracker for how much potion you have.
* Blackmailed for the Blackmail Event eligibility
* FlowerGirlFavor/TDSFavor for the Flower Girl and the Nameless Ronin; it is difficult to get TDS Favor!

## BC Skills
* NotNewCaptive is how BC tracks who has been fed through the system to generate all these skills! "Introductions"
* CaptiveEsteem is only partially fleshed out, it tracks "Pride".
* Deflowered is TB's virginity tracking, but it is merely the negative condition, requiring a whole ecosystem:
* Virginal is whether or not the character is a virgin; this is only set on young maidens.
* Maiden is whether YOU know they are virginal or not; this is only set if they admit it to you or other harem girls!
* Trustee is a flag for elevated privileges for some new Captive and Companion events.
* Jealousy is a skill to track how protective a Companion is.
* Raging is intended to track when you have worked yourself up into a frenzy, to prevent you from leaving the bedroom.
* Breakable isn't really finished, but it is supposed to indicate working on the Self-Esteem/Humiliation line.
* InTorture is whether you have left them in the Torture Chamber, to eliminate them from many random events they shouldn't get.
* CaptorBuying was supposed to be a flag to let the Slave Trader know to come by. I turned this off and left the trader inside the Harem with the Procuress.
* CaptiveStripped is a flag to prevent multi-clothes-stealing bug.
* Fame, "Bedroom Notoriety" (also not very fleshed out yet) is a measure of how "well-known" you are in certain circles of ill-repute...
* CaptiveOffLimits is set when you decline the initial flirtation, allows you to eventually re-ignite passions with an NPC.
